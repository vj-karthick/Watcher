**🚀 Kubernetes CRD Watcher Project**
**📌 Project Title**

**Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRD) Watcher using Go**

**📖 Description**

This project demonstrates how to create a **Custom Resource Definition (CRD)** in Kubernetes and build a **Go-based watcher** that continuously monitors custom resources and logs events when new custom objects are created.

It shows how Kubernetes can be extended using CRDs and how external programs (controllers/watchers) can interact with the Kubernetes API using Go.
